# IH-Leaflet-Velocity-TS

A **TypeScript fork** of [leaflet-velocity-ts](https://github.com/0nza1101/leaflet-velocity-ts), which itself is based on the original [leaflet-velocity](https://github.com/onaci/leaflet-velocity) plugin for Leaflet.

This plugin allows for the visualization of velocity fields such as wind or ocean currents in Leaflet maps. This fork extends the functionality with a üåä **new wave visualization mode**.

## üß¨ Project Lineage

- üì¶ **[leaflet-velocity](https://github.com/onaci/leaflet-velocity)** ‚Äì Original plugin developed under CSIRO license.
- üß™ **[leaflet-velocity-ts](https://github.com/0nza1101/leaflet-velocity-ts)** ‚Äì TypeScript rewrite with performance and compatibility improvements.
- üåä **ih-leaflet-velocity-ts** ‚Äì This fork adds **wave representation** capabilities.

## üîÑ Differences from the Original Repositories

Compared to `leaflet-velocity-ts`, this fork adds:

- üåä **Wave Mode**:
  - Wave-style particle animations.
  - Wave height visualization with dynamic sizing and color scaling.
  - Support for additional wave-specific display options.

- üõ†Ô∏è API Extensions:
  - New options for configuring wave particle behavior.
  - Updated control panel to include wave data display (height, etc.).

## ‚ú® Usage

To use this fork, install or copy the package into your project. Import and use the plugin as follows:

```javascript
const velocityLayer = L.velocityLayer({
  displayValues: true,
  displayOptions: {
    velocityType: "Global Wind",
    position: "bottomleft",
    emptyString: "No data",
    angleConvention: "bearingCW",
    showCardinal: true,
    speedUnit: "m/s",
    directionString: "Direction",
    speedString: "Speed",
    heightString: "Height",   // üåä Wave-specific
    heightUnit: "m"           // üåä Wave-specific
  },
  data: data, // see demo/*.json or use a compatible data service

  minVelocity: 0,
  maxVelocity: 10,
  velocityScale: 0.005,
  colorScale: [],
  opacity: 0.97,
  paneName: "overlayPane",
  particlelineWidth: 1.9,

  // üåä WAVE MODE CONFIG
  waveMode: true,
  wavesParticlesSeparation: 3.5
});
```

## üåä Wave Mode Details

When `waveMode` is enabled:

- **Particles** animate with wave-like appearance rather than simple motion streaks.
- **Wave Height** is read from the third data parameter (typically `[u, v, height]`) and used to scale the wave particles by size and color.
- **Control Panel** includes height data (if available), displaying wave intensity alongside speed and direction.

### Additional Wave Options

| Option                    | Type     | Default | Description                                                        |
|---------------------------|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `waveMode`                | `boolean`| `false` | Enable wave visualization mode.                                    |
| `wavesParticlesSeparation`| `number` | `3.5`   | Controls the spacing between particles in wave mode.               |
| `heightString`            | `string` | `"Height"` | Label prefix for wave height in the control.                    |
| `heightUnit`              | `string` | `"m"`   | Unit of wave height displayed in the control.                      |
